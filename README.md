# ❗ Goodbye ❗️

As [GitKraken Boards has sunset](https://www.gitkraken.com/boards-and-timelines) at the end of 2022 this project has no use anymore. It was fun while it lasted.

## Getting started

Head over to [Kraggl](https://kraggl.com).

Or get the Express server running locally:

- Create a new [Glo App](https://app.gitkraken.com/oauth_apps)
- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `GIT_KRAKEN_CLIENT_ID="CLIENT_ID OF YOUR NEW GLO APP" GIT_KRAKEN_CLIENT_SECRET="CLIENT_SECRET OF YOUR NEW GLO APP" npm start` to start the local server

Go to `localhost:3000` to view the Kraggl homepage.

## Deployment

A `Dockerfile` is provided and can be used in a `docker-compose` setup.

Example `docker-compose` service:

```YAML
kraggl:
    image: lichtblau/kraggl:latest
    environment:
        GIT_KRAKEN_CLIENT_ID: "YOUR CLIENT_ID"
        GIT_KRAKEN_CLIENT_SECRET: "YOUR CLIENT_SECRET"
    volumes:
        - kraggl-data:/usr/src/app/database
```

And don't forget to add the volume to persist the SQLite database:

```YAML
volumes:
  kraggl-data:
```
